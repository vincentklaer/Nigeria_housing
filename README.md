This project focuses on predicting annual rent prices in Lagos, Nigeria using a dataset from Kaggle  oai_citation:0‡DSF Project Research Report Group 7.pdf. Through thorough data cleaning, feature engineering (including location-based variables), and iterative experimentation with multiple regression models, we sought to accurately capture rent price determinants. Ultimately, a random forest regressor outperformed other approaches, achieving an R² of around 57%  oai_citation:1‡DSF Project Research Report Group 7.pdf. However, location data sparsity outside the most common areas remains a challenge for broader model generalization.
