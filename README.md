This project focuses on predicting annual rent prices in Lagos, Nigeria using a dataset from Kaggle. Through thorough data cleaning, feature engineering (including location-based variables), and iterative experimentation with multiple regression models, we sought to accurately capture rent price determinants. Ultimately, a random forest regressor outperformed other approaches, achieving an RÂ² of around 57%. However, location data sparsity outside the most common areas remains a challenge for broader model generalization.
